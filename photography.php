                <p>This fountain was the first picture I took with the intent to edit 
                    and post. My inexperience led me to mutiple shoots as I forgot my 
                    tripod or it was too bright. Eventually, I captured this final draft.

                <p>This individual is Chris. I eagerly asked Chris to allow me to 
                    take shots during his band's performance. At their performance right 
                    outside of Meraki's in Boise, ID, I took hundreds of photos. I promised 
                    I would edit some and send them his way. Ultimately, only one managed 
                    to survive to the final draft. As a musician myself, I loved the 
                    passion and fire they give when they perform.

                <p>I photographed this photo during my trip to Japan. In the 
                    Shinjuku National Park, I found this flower. Another Japanese 
                    photographer was having his shoot, so after he was done, I thought 
                    I would give it a try. It was my first time getting really close to 
                    a subject, but I feel confident on this final draft.

                <p>I wanted an excuse to hangout with a girl I liked so of course
                     the most natural thing was to ask her if I could take a picture 
                     of her light sabers. She surprisingly accepted and there I managed 
                     to take some long exposure shots to get these cool patterns. It was a 
                     pain to edit, but this was the first time I edited so heavily. It was a 
                     valuable lesson with a fun story attached to it.

                This is probably one of my favorite photos I have taken so far. Often as a 
                photographer, you find yourself lucky to be in a position to take a certain 
                shot. People wait for hours to get the shot they want. I happened to be walking 
                up to this ferris wheel in Japan with a couple of friends when I saw this 
                view. I told my friends to wait so I can snap this moment. After we got off 
                the ferris wheel, it was dark. I would not have had another chance to get this shot.
