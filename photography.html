                <p>This was the first photo I took with the intent of editing and posting as a "photographer." It was take at Albertson Park in Boise
                    Id. I took multiple trips since I forgot a tripod on multiple occassions which was vital for a shot like this. For a first photo, 
                    I think it is acceptable.

                <p>I took this photo at my friend Chris' band performance outside of Meraki's in Boise, Id. I had met him at a party and I pestered him enough to let
                    me take a pictures of his band during his performance. Despite hundreds of photos, I could only accept this photo. I love the passion of musicians.
